**aedocoding/aedocoding** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing tutorials for coding a backend in Knex + Node.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply algorithms and data structures to coding challenges (again)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me if I'm interested in any job opportunities you might know of!
